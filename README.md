## üéØ What This App Does

Skids Soundscape provides a preliminary hearing screening to help identify potential hearing concerns. This is **not a substitute for professional medical evaluation** but serves as an initial assessment tool to determine if further professional testing is recommended.

## üî¨ The Science of Sound & Hearing

### How We Hear
Sound travels as vibrations through the air, measured in **frequency (Hz)** and **intensity (dB)**:
- **Frequency**: How high or low a sound is (pitch)
- **Intensity**: How loud or soft a sound is (volume)

### Frequency Ranges We Test
- **250 Hz**: Deep, rumbling sounds (like thunder)
- **500 Hz**: Low-pitched sounds (like a male voice)
- **1000 Hz**: Mid-range sounds (normal conversation)
- **2000 Hz**: Higher sounds (like a child's voice)
- **4000 Hz**: High-pitched sounds (like birds chirping)
- **8000 Hz**: Very high sounds (like crickets)

### Your Hearing System
1. **Outer Ear**: Collects sound waves
2. **Middle Ear**: Amplifies vibrations
3. **Inner Ear**: Converts vibrations to nerve signals
4. **Brain**: Interprets the signals as sound

## üéß Getting Ready for Your Test

### Before You Start
1. **Find a Quiet Space**: Choose the quietest room available
2. **Use Good Headphones**: Over-ear headphones work best

4. **Stay Alert**: The test requires your full attention
5. **Remove Distractions**: Put away phones and other devices

### What to Expect
- **6 Different Frequencies**: From low rumbles to high chirps
- **Both Ears Tested**: Each ear tested separately
- **Multiple Intensity Levels**: Sounds get softer until you can't hear them
- **Visual Cues**: Pictures help you understand what you're listening for
- **About 60-80 Tones Total**: Approximately 10-15 tones per frequency per ear

### During the Test
- **Listen Carefully**: Some sounds will be very quiet
- **Respond Immediately**: Click "I Hear It" as soon as you detect any sound
- **Don't Guess**: Only respond when you actually hear something
- **Stay Focused**: The test adapts based on your responses
- **Take Breaks**: You can pause if needed

## üéµ Sound Examples You'll Hear

The test uses pure tones similar to these familiar sounds:

- **250 Hz**: Like a large truck engine idling
- **500 Hz**: Like a foghorn or deep male voice
- **1000 Hz**: Like a telephone ring or normal conversation
- **2000 Hz**: Like a smoke detector beep
- **4000 Hz**: Like a whistle or high-pitched alarm
- **8000 Hz**: Like a cricket chirping or tea kettle whistle
